	<p>As many as 15,000 dolphins are killed yearly for use as shark bait and human
	consumption by Peruvian fishermen.</p>

	<p>A BlueVoice/Mundo Azul expedition has returned with damning evidence of a
	massive hunt for dolphins carried out by Peruvian fishermen. This expedition
	follows an earlier expedition conducted by UK-based Ecostorm in collaboration
	with Mundo Azul.</p>

	<p>BlueVoice provided full funding for the Mundo Azul expedition and partial
	funding for the Ecostorm effort.</p>

	<p>Both expeditions brought back graphic video and photographic evidence of
	massive dolphin killing by Peruvian fishermen. Dolphins are harpooned, clubbed
	to death and then butchered to be used as shark bait. Dolphins are also killed
	for human consumption.</p>

	<p>The president of Mundo Azul, Stefan Austermuhle who led the investigative
	expedition, reported "We videotaped from the boat and in the water and what
	we saw was unimaginably horrific. I just went numb looking at the pitiful
	dolphin being battered with a club. All I could do was continue recording
	the event in the hope that making the world aware of this tragedy can somehow
	bring an end to it."</p>

	<img class="left img-half island-1-2" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/news_perudolphin02.jpg" alt="">

	<p>Based on the size of the Peruvian fleet and interviews with the fishermen
	Austermuhle estimates as many as fifteen thousand dolphins are killed for
	bait and human consumption by the Peruvian fishing fleet in this manner. An
	unknown additional number are killed in the driftnet fishery.</p>

	<p>Killing dolphins is illegal in Peru but the laws are difficult to enforce
	on the high seas. However, dolphin meat is sold in markets on shore and could
	be controlled at that point, if police were willing to do so.</p>

	<p>Mako sharks, which are dangerous on deck, are cut behind the head to sever
	the spine. The fishermen cut the entire rostrum off the blue sharks.</p>

	<p>In 2010, the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) added the shortfin mako
	shark, one of the species taken off Peru, to Annex I (Migratory species
	threatened with extinction) of its Migratory Species listing. The vessel
	on which Austermuhle travelled fished primarily over a series of sea mounts
	where fish, including sharks aggregate. The sea mounts also attract dolphins
	due to the abundance of fish.</p>

	<p>Though it is well known that Peruvian fishermen take hundreds of sharks,
	until now the world has been unaware of the vast slaughter of dolphins off
	Peru. Many are keenly aware of the dreadful killing of dolphins at Taiji,
	Japan and assume that is the largest slaughter of dolphins in the world;
	far from it. In fact, the killing of dolphins for food, called dolphin bush
	meat, is a worldwide problem and may be growing as traditional fisheries collapse.</p>

	<p>When Stefan Austermuhle approached us with the horrifying information
	about the numbers of dolphins killed off Peru we were determined to provide
	the means for him to document these horrors. So BlueVoice funded expeditions
	to obtain proof of the slaughter. He spent three weeks aboard a sordid little
	fishing boat putting himself at grave personal risk. And he brought back the
	evidence we need to bust this tragic process.</p>

	<p>BlueVoice, in collaboration with Mundo Azul and other conservation organizations
	will now bring this story to the media and to international councils and commissions.</p>
