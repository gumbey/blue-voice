    <p>An international effort to end the brutal slaughter of dolphins in Peru has been
    initiated by a coalition of marine conservation organizations headed up by BlueVoice.org
    and Peruvian-based Mundo Azul. The campaign is aimed at fishing practices that rely on
    killing dolphins to use as shark bait.</p>

    <p>Video of the slaughter of dolphins and the catch of undersized sharks off the coast
    of Peru was obtained by the Peruvian NGO Mundo Azul in cooperation with Florida-based
    BlueVoice. Based on calculations of the number of fishing boats and undercover testimony
    documenting the numbers of dolphins taken it is estimated that between five and fifteen
    thousand dolphins are killed yearly.</p>

    <p>Stefan Austermuhle, president of Mundo Azul, noted "It is illegal to kill dolphins
    under Peruvian law but there is no enforcement so fishermen kill dolphins with impunity."</p>

    <p>BlueVoice and Mundo Azul have conducted undercover surveys of the sale of dolphin
    meat and found several locations where illegal sales were taking place. But the
    number was few relative to years past, perhaps indicating the sale of dolphin meat
    is being driven underground. There will be continuous surveys of fish markets over
    the coming months ana network of concerned citizens has been formed to report
    violations of dolphin protection laws to Mundo Azul's office in Lima.</p>

    <p>In addition a bounty of $500 is being offered for information leading to the arrest
    and conviction of anyone harming dolphins. "We want the fishermen to know they cannot
    carry on their dolphin killing and meat sales without exposure", said Hardy Jones,
    executive director of BlueVoice.</p>

    <p>Jones presented to Stefan Austermuhle The Dolphin Defender Award in recognition of
    his work documenting the killing of dolphins in the shark fishery. Austermuhle spent
    24 days aboard a small Peruvian fishing boat to</p>

    <p>Footage from his expedition will be cut into a documentary film analogous to The
    Academy Award winning film The Cove. "It is my hope that our film will have a happy
    ending in which Peru rededicates itself to the protection of dolphins and its marine
    resources," said Jones who has produced more than 70 documentaries for television.</p>

    <p>BlueVoice and Mundo Azul have called on the Peruvian government to both enforce
    existing laws and enact legislation banning harpoons on fishing boats. "Harpoons
    are used solely to kill dolphins and banning them would save the lives of thousands
    of dolphins," said Austermuhle.</p>
