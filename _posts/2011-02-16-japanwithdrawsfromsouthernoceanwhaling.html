    <p>Herman Melville made the hunt for Moby Dick sound like a noble pitting of
    man’s wits against a ferocious leviathan of the sea. But the history of man’s
    killing of these giant creatures is a bloody tale of persecution, greed, and stupidity.</p>

    <p>Whaling has been going on for hundreds of years, but it wasn’t until about
    100 years ago that the first whaling station was established in Antarctica. At
    first, whaling there took a few hundreds of whales a year. But within a decade,
    advances in shipbuilding and the invention of the harpoon cannon drove the death
    toll into the thousands. By the mid 1920s, the arrival of British and Norwegian
    factory ships pushed the slaughter still higher.</p>

    <p>And by the mid 1930s, the waters surrounding the Antarctic had become an international
    whale-killing field. Whaling fleets from the U.K., the U.S., Argentina, Denmark, Japan,
    Norway, the Netherlands, Russia, and Germany hunted with explosive harpoons and sent whale
    populations plummeting. Many species have been pushed toward the brink of extinction.
    Blue whales once numbered about 275,000; there are now fewer than 5,000 remaining.</p>

    <p>During the last 2 centuries, humpback whales have been hunted intensively,
    especially in the southern hemisphere, where it is estimated that populations
    were reduced to a few percent of their pre-exploitation abundance (Chapman 1974).
    Based on catch records corrected for illegal Soviet whaling, a total of more than
    200,000 humpback whales were killed from 1904 to 1980 (Clapham & Baker 2002).</p>

    <p>In 1946, the International Whaling Commission recognized that “…it is essential
    to protect all species from over-fishing.” Nevertheless, the industry had too much
    power for any meaningful restrictions until 1965, when the IWC banned the catching
    of blue whales in the Antarctic. Some whalers moved to smaller species; others
    cheated. The Russian whaling fleet, according to Greenpeace, caught more than
    90,000 whales illegally in the Antarctic between 1965 and the late 1970s.</p>

    <p>Some countries stopped whaling in the Antarctic, but Russia, Japan, and other
    countries continued the hunt. Japan gets around whaling limits by calling its
    catch “scientific.” A fire in the Japanese whaling-factory ship Nisshin Maru put
    an early end to Japan’s 2007 Antarctic whaling hunt. But that ship will likely
    be repaired, probably in time to begin whaling in the North Pacific later this
    year. This, in spite of almost universal condemnation of Japan’s “scientific”
    whale slaughter.</p>

    <p>Japan takes a deadly toll on the world’s whale population. According to the
    Australian government, Japan killed more than 6,500 Antarctic minke whales during
    the 18 years it was conducting “research” on the whales, though there are ample
    non-lethal methods for learning the same things. Japan justifies its continuing
    depletion of these magnificent cetaceans on economic grounds, though few Japanese
    have a taste for whale meat (they prefer McDonald’s these days), and much of the
    butchered flesh from Japanese hunts winds up being stored in freezers as there is
    insufficient market demand.</p>

    <p>Japan has few allies in its whaling position, but manages to secure votes in
    the International Whaling Commission by the payment of quid-pro-quo financial aid
    (totaling nearly half a billion U.S. dollars) to developing Caribbean countries
    including Grenada, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Solomon Islands.</p>

    <p>Moral issues aside, Japan’s whaling may be in violation of the Convention on
    the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, to which Japan is a signatory.
    Article II of the Convention requires that “Any harvesting and associated activities
    [in the Antarctic must prevent]…decrease in the size of any harvested population to
    levels below those which ensure its stable recruitment…[and] prevention of changes…in
    the marine ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades…”</p>

    <p>One of the justifications Japan and other whaling nations cite to justify the hunt
    is that “whales eat too many fish” and must be controlled as part of marine ecosystem
    management. This is simply untrue. Many whales don’t eat fish at all; they eat krill.
    Of the thousands of whales cut open between 1987 and 2005, the overwhelming majority
    had not a single fish in their stomachs. A total of less than 300 pounds of fish was
    found in all the whales in all those years of “research”.</p>

    <p>Consumers can make a difference. Environmentalist pressure recently caused Nissui,
    the parent company of Gorton’s Seafood and New Zealand-based Sealord, to withdraw its
    support for the whaling activities of its corporate cousin, Kyodo Senpaku. Nissui has
    announced that it will sell its shares in Kyodo, and end its involvement in the whaling
    business.</p>

    <p>In Iceland, the government decision to resume whaling last year, in spite of an
    international moratorium, precipitated a boycott by would-be whale-watching tourists.
    Unless the boycott forces the government to change its mind, 30 minke whales and 9
    fin whales could perish this year.</p>

    <p>When the International Whaling Commission meets in May, Japan will try to use its
    influence to bring about an end the moratorium on commercial whaling. If the slaughter
    is to be stopped, it will take the concerted efforts of the powerful anti-whaling
    nations on the Commission: the U.S., Australia, the U.K., and Germany. The eyes of
    the world will be watching.</p>
