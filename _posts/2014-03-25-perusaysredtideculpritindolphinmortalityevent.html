According to early reports, a toxic alga that destroys the organs of the animals is the cause of the mass mortality event that has killed hundreds of dolphins off the northern coast of Peru.
</p>
<p>
A preliminary report of the Instituto del Mar del Peru (Imarpe) indicates that dolphins and other mammals, such as seals and porpoises that beached in recent weeks on the beaches of Piura and Lambayeque perished by degeneration in various internal organs. The cause is thought be toxic algae that is activated during the summer by various climatic factors and pollution.
The results of four tissue samples of dolphin and a penguin were subjected to pathological examination showed that organs such as the kidney, liver, brain and adrenal glands of the animals showed degenerative indications
</p>
<p>
The veteranarians of IMARPE, (Peruâ€™s Institute of Marine Studies) determined that the spleens and lymphatic systems of the dead animals had beeen diminished demonstrating that they suffered a moderate decline in their immune systems.
</p>
<h2>DEADLY ALGAL BLOOM</h2>
<p>
The report indicates that the animals were possibly poisoned by eating a poisonous algae that occurs naturally in the sea, which is triggered by the change of summer temperature and pollution, among other factors.
</p>
<p>
IMARPE is still awaiting the full results of the analyzes performed on animals and phytoplankton to determine with certainty if the algae is causing the deaths.
</p>
<h2>STILL DYING</h2>
<p>
Specialists from IMARPE of Piura, Lambayeque (Santa Rosa) and central Peruvian coast continue to record more dead animals in the northern beaches. It is estimated that in the last 10 days 100 dolphins, waterfowl, turtles and sea lions were found dead.
The Regional Manager of Production for Lambayeque officially has a record of 459 dolphins, porpoises, sea lions, turtles and birds that beached on the coast of Lambayeque and reserving Illescas, located south of Piura.

NB: Unusual mortality events are also occurring along the eastern coast of the United States, in the Indian River Lagoon of eastern Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico.
