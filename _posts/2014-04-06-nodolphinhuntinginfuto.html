I just received word from Mr. Ishii, the former dolphin hunter who is now leading whale and dolphin watching trips. Great news!! 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I attended the Annual meeting of the Ito(Futo) Fishermen's Union.
</p>
<p>
Their Annual Report says that their target for dolphin sales this
year .. is ZERO yen! This is because there have been no sales of dolphin for several years in Futo.I believe that there are various reasons but one of them must be people's unspoken resistance.......
But the fishermen are still waiting for the chance to hunt.
Let's continue our silent, well-mannered resistance with the words
"We are free!"
