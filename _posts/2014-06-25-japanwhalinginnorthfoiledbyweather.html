<p>
Japan's so-called research whaling in waters off Northern Japan, scheduled to start Monday, was postponed to Tuesday or later due to bad weather. 
</p>
<p>
The Japan Fisheries Agency said the whaling season, which will run through early June, will be held with a quota of up to 60 minke whales for biological research.

The first whale caught will be tested for traces of radioactive substances, in the wake of the nuclear crisis at the radiation-leaking Fukushima Daiichi atomic power plant, which was crippled due to the quake-tsunami disaster.
