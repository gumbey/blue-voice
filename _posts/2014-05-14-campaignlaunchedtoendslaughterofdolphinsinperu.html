The award will be presented by Hardy Jones, executive director of BlueVoice, a Florida-based marine conservation organization. Jones is known for his work of more than 35 years protecting dolphins. He is also an award winning filmmaker who appears in the Academy Award winning film The Cove - a film that caused worldwide outrage at the slaughter of dolphins in Japan.

Jones is currently writing a book on his experiences in Peru with mass mortality events of dolphins and the consumption of dolphin meat for human consumption. He is in conversation with the producers of The Cove for a followup to that film covering the killing of dolphins in Peru for sharkbait.
