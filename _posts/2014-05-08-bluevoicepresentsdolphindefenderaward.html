An international effort to end the brutal slaughter of dolphins in Peru has been
initiated by a coalition of marine conservation organizations headed up by BlueVoice.org
and Peruvian-based Mundo Azul. The campaign is aimed at fishing practices that rely on
killing dolphins to use as shark bait.

Video of the slaughter of dolphins and the catch of undersized sharks off the coast
of Peru was obtained by the Peruvian NGO Mundo Azul in cooperation with Florida-based
BlueVoice. Based on calculations of the number of fishing boats and undercover testimony
documenting the numbers of dolphins taken it is estimated that between five and fifteen
thousand dolphins are killed yearly.

Stefan Austermuhle, president of Mundo Azul, noted "It is illegal to kill dolphins
under Peruvian law but there is no enforcement so fishermen kill dolphins with impunity."

BlueVoice and Mundo Azul have conducted undercover surveys of the sale of dolphin
meat and found several locations where illegal sales were taking place. But the
number was few relative to years past, perhaps indicating the sale of dolphin meat
is being driven underground. There will be continuous surveys of fish markets over
the coming months ana network of concerned citizens has been formed to report
violations of dolphin protection laws to Mundo Azul's office in Lima.

In addition a bounty of $500 is being offered for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of anyone harming dolphins. "We want the fishermen to know they cannot
carry on their dolphin killing and meat sales without exposure", said Hardy Jones,
executive director of BlueVoice.

Jones presented to Stefan Austermuhle The Dolphin Defender Award in recognition of
his work documenting the killing of dolphins in the shark fishery. Austermuhle spent

Footage from his expedition will be cut into a documentary film analogous to The
Academy Award winning film The Cove. "It is my hope that our film will have a happy
ending in which Peru rededicates itself to the protection of dolphins and its marine
resources," said Jones who has produced more than 70 documentaries for television.

BlueVoice and Mundo Azul have called on the Peruvian government to both enforce
existing laws and enact legislation banning harpoons on fishing boats. "Harpoons
are used solely to kill dolphins and banning them would save the lives of thousands
of dolphins," said Austermuhle.
