    <p>When I sat down with my old friend Ken Balcomb to discuss the plight of the
    killer whales he has studied for more than twenty years. I was in for a terrible shock.</p>

    <p>In 1982 I made my first trip to the San Juan Islands in Washington State to
    meet Ken, regarded today as one of the foremost authorities on killer whales on
    earth. Ken was using dorsal fins and saddle markings to identify individual whales.</p>

    <p>I was fascinated to compare the techniques he used with killer whales with
    the approach we had in our studies of spotted dolphins in the Bahamas. The killer
    whales who pass through the San Juans are known as J, K and L pods and together
    are called the southern resident pods because they spend large parts of the year
    in the inland waters of the Pacific Northwest. They come here through the Straights
    of Juan da Fuca on their way up to the Fraser River in Canada following schools of
    salmon on which they feed.</p>

    <p>Though the pods often travel together each has its own unique approach to
    feeding on salmon and each pod has a distinct vocal repertoire. It is clear
    that information is passed from one generation to another – an indication that
    these orca have a culture.</p>

    <p>These are some of the best-known and most beloved marine mammals on earth.
    The identities of all members of the pod are known, in some cases the family
    tree can be identified going back decades.</p>

    <p>They may also be the most contaminated marine mammals on earth. And from
    1995 – 2000 ten of the males in J, K, and L pods died. While there is no
    absolute proof that they died from contaminants such as PCBs, their carcasses
    did contain astronomical levels of these deadly toxins.</p>

    <p>I learned these heart breaking facts while Ken and I screened film I had
    shot in the late 1980s and mid 90s. He told me all the males in the footage
    we were screening had died since those marvelous days when we had followed
    them on their feeding runs through Haro Straight and Boundary Pass.</p>

    <p>As Ken told the story “From ‘95 on we started having a pretty serious mortality.
    What’s really interesting about that footage is that virtually all the adult
    males that are in there are now deceased. . . just in a period of less than
    20 years we’ve lost most of the adult males in the whole southern resident
    community.”</p>

    <p>“We’ve attributed most of the mortality to the PCB levels in the tissues.
    Their immune systems are depressed, much like aids, so they don’t defend themselves
    against common bacteria. And also their reproductive systems don’t develop.”</p>

    <p>Later we headed out on the water. As we approached turn point a mother moved
    past us close to the boat with her calf nursing. The reason females are surviving
    and so many males are not is that when a mother orca nurses her calf she offloads
    huge amounts of chemicals such as pcbs that are stored in her lipid rich milk.
    Often first-born calves do not survive. But second and third born survive after
    the mother is unburdened of much of her toxic load.</p>

    <p>These high food chain predators live just off Seattle, Washington. The killer
    whales here probably pick up their burden of contaminants from local sources.
    But industrial chemicals are contaminating the ocean ecosystem worldwide and
    are spread on the winds and tides. Some PCBs in these waters have come from as
    far away as China.</p>

    <p>The tragedy of the resident pods is the flip side of the joy I experience
    being with killer whales in the wild. Having a personal knowledge of these whales,
    knowing their names and thrilling to them as they travel, feed, and socialize makes
    their deaths a personal experience of deep sadness.</p>

    <p>The toxic chemicals that have so impacted the southern resident pods are not
    just a threat to fish and marine mammals – it is now clearly a threat to humans.</p>

    <p>But there is some good news. Despite the loss of so many – particularly males
    and calves, the southern resident pods are now increasing in number... from a
    low of 76 to a current population of 87. Four calves were born during the summer
    and fall of 2004 and as of February 2005 all had survived.</p>
