	<p>After U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy tweeted that she is “concerned about
	the inhumaneness“ of the dolphin hunt at Taiji world attention was once again focused
	on that small village east of Osaka.</p>

	<p>As when The Cove won an academy award, protests erupted and demands for an end to
	this brutal practice flooded into Japanese embassies and ministries.</p>

	<p>Hardy Jones and BlueVoice have been working to stop the slaughter of dolphins in
	Japan since 1979, first at Iki, where the killing did end as a result of film taken
	by Jones of the slaughters airing around the world, and later at Futo where there
	has been only one hunt since we helped start dolphin watching tours in 2002. Jones
	and BlueVoice worked consistently at Taiji beginning in 2001 but had rescued 200
	mellonheaded whales there as early as 1980.</p>

	<p>It should be remembered that Taiji is not the only place in the world where
	dolphins are killed. Elsewhere in Japan up to 18,000 Dall’s porpoise were killed
	yearly until the tsunami destroyed the boats and facilities. Now that hunt is rebuilding.</p>

	<p>The reasons for dolphin hunts vary from place to place. In Iki it was pure predator
	eradication. In Futo as in Taiji, it’s for meat and to capture dolphins for captivity.
	In Hokkaido it’s strictly for food.</p>

	<p>As we documented in Peru, some fifteen thousand dolphins are killed for shark bait
	each year. Dolphins are also taken either intentionally or as bycatch and used for
	food. In addition mass mortality events involving the deaths of hundreds of dolphins
	have occurred in Peru in 2012 and 2014. </p>

	<p>Large numbers of dolphins are killed in Vietnam and Indonesia for shark bait.
	In the Faroe Islands thousands of dolphins, pilot whales are killed in the infamous
	“grinds”.</p>

	<p>BlueVoice and Mundo Azul have called on the Peruvian government to both enforce
	existing laws and enact legislation banning harpoons on fishing boats. "Harpoons
	are used solely to kill dolphins and banning them would save the lives of thousands
	of dolphins," said Austermuhle.</p>
